## Briefly

An abandoned house in the middle of a graveyard with weird lights hanging around

This is a simple project, done with only main assets of Three.js such as; Animations, Materials, Geometries, Textures, Lights, Shadows, Cameras
and simply basic and beautiful Scene which is a combination of all

You can use your mouse to hang around and also can use the control panel at the top-right corner of the page, to control and change some of the features inside the scene
